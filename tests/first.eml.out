This Friday, October 4th at 4pm UTC our new programming challenge - Codility Boron 2013 - will go live.

If you are the first one to deliver the perfect solution, a signed Golden Award, the Champion's T-Shirt and the great "Looking for a Challenge? (http://www.lookingforachallengethebook.com/) " book will be on their way to you soon. Also, we will be happy to add your name to the growing hall of fame, just next to Chenyang Wu, Denis Yudin and Xiongjun Liang, who came in first, second and third in our previous challenge.

NEW: Everyone submitting a solution to the challenge will have access to a Codility report assessing it. Let us know if you find this helpful!
